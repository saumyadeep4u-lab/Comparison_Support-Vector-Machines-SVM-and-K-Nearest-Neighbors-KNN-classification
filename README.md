# Comparison_Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-and-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-classification
This project focuses on building and evaluating two supervised machine learning models — Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — using the Iris dataset.  The objective is to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
